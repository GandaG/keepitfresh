*A simpler way to freshen up your frozen applications*

> :warning: **Note**: This is a mature library with all planned features added and no known bugs - do not be alarmed by the lack of commits.

*keepitfresh* serves as an auto-updater for frozen applications.
Inspired by [uscan](https://manpages.debian.org/jessie/devscripts/uscan.1.en.html),
it's incredibly modular giving you full control over every step.

See below for a quick tutorial!
